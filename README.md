# CustomChartView
My first flutter project of practicing financial instruments

My current plan for the project is to get financial instrument data from a source
Historical data might be appended using k_chart flutter library
Live data might also be appended using stream data methods (research and find appropriate solution)


I have a crazy idea, i wanna connect my metatrader 4 data to node.js backend and connect that with flutter to manipulate the data.
